# authorize_request function has responsibility for authorizing user requests. first, 
# we need to get a token in the header with ‘Authorization’ as a key. with this token now we can decode and get the payload value. 
# In this application, we define user_id in the payload. 

# You should not include the user credentials data into the payload because it will cause security issues, you can include data that is needed to authorize the user. 
# When performing JsonWebToken.decode function, it will return JWT::DecodeError if there was an error like token was expired, token not valid, token missing, etc. 
# After we got user_id from the payload then we will try to find the user by id and assign it into current_user variable, 
# If the user does not exist it will return ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound and it will render an error message with HTTP status unauthorized.
